## ðŸ‘¾ Introduction

For five weeks I'm going to work on Ringo.pro for the final assignment of the minor web development @ hva. Together with [Nick](https://github.com/CountNick), we will build a proof-of-concept they can show to possible clients. This repo will be for my personal development. The Ringo project repo can be found [here](https://github.com/CountNick/Ringo.Pro)
