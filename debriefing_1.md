# Debriefing

# Introduction

On the 18th of May team Ringo had their first meeting with the people at Ringo. Team Ringo consist of myself and Nick. The people at Ringo are Jo and Marcel. Before the meeting Jo had sent us a briefing with the general idea behind Ringo.

# What is Ringo?

With Ringo.pro Marcel and Jo want to bring the "sync" industry to the 21st century. The process of finding and licensing music for motion pictures is now a tedious, long and confusing process. Ringo wants to make this process easier, faster and accessible to everyone with their platform. The benefits of the Ringo platform is that it is **time-saving, seamless and intuitive**.

The tone of the company is **clean, simple and refreshing**. This means that the platform has to have a clean UI. They value **freedom, creativity and independence**.

# What is the goal?

Ringo has a long term goal: "A music supervisor should be able to find, license and pay for the perfect piece of music within five days. At the moment, this process can take up to two months". This is their long-term goal. Off course this goal isn't possible to do in five weeks. So I have a different goal: **"After these five weeks I want to have build - together with Nick - a functional prototype that Ringo can use for to show to potential clients"**.

# Who are the users?

The main users of Ringo are **music supervisors**. These music supervisors handle the creative, legal and operational processes for music licensing on behalf of an advertiser, TV show, film or other content or/and media producer. With the prototype we are primarily focussing on the music supervisors.

# What does the user want?

- user wants to search for music → by artist, genre, mood, date, song-title etc.
- user wants to see who he has to contact
- user wants to see what he has to do (enquiries)
- user wants to see the status of his enquiries → maybe the user gets also e-mail notifications?
- user wants to save and see his current projects

# What do we need?

- Songs and info → Spotify API
- Song lyrics → Genius API
- Data about the people who does the licensing → fake data

# How are we going to do it?

Nick and I had a discussion today. During this discussion, we decided that we are going to work together. We believe that we can do more and make a bigger proof-of-concept if we are working together. We decided that we are both going to make sketches of how we think Ringo is going to look. These sketches are we going to discuss tomorrow. We are also going to have a demo each week.

## Rough planning

### Week 1:

- Deciding how [Ringo.pro](http://ringo.pro) is going to look (sketches etc.).
- Debriefing.
- Make a basic UI.
- Experimenting with the Spotify API and the Genius API.
- Demo.

### Week 2:

- Start with the search functionality.
- Demo.

### Week 3:

- Work further on the search functionality.
- Start working on the enquiries functionality.
- Demo.

### Week 4:

- Work on the enquiries functionality.
- Work on the projects functionality.
- Start optimizing → GULP etc.
- Demo.

### Week 5:

- Check the front-end checklist.
- Demo.
- Expo.

## How are we going to work together?

Nick and I decided to communicate mainly through Slack and Discord. In Discord we will be (video) calling each other. With Jo and Marcel we can communicate through e-mail. We also have a Slack channel for Ringo. This channel consist of Marcel, Jo, Nick, Joost and myself. We also do video calls with Jo and Marcel. All our communication will be in English.

Nick and I have made a collaborated GitHub repository - this can be found [here](https://github.com/CountNick/Ringo.Pro) - where we will work in during this project.

# Where lies our focus?

Our main focus will be the search functionality. The proof-of-concept we will be building will also be limited to desktop users only.
