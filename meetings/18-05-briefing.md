# 18 May briefing

Jo Sandow & Marcel Alexander Wiebeuga

ringo.pro

Platform for finding music for videos.

Looking for music and the contacts for the licensing

Two types of licensing:

- publishing: the writing; lyrics and medolies
- master: the recording; audio

The focus lies with the buyers.

Dashboard

Spotify api

The focus lies on the search functionality

The enquiries section is like a to do list with notifications etc..

The projects section is the section with all the current user projects.

Limit to laptop.

The essence is to make a working prototype. (to show people)

We can use fake data for the music licensing like contacts etc..

We can use the Spotify API for the music library.

Clean form. Like the one in the briefing. Joost also gave two examples:

The color scheme and ui has to be playful but also a bit sober. The platform will be used by people who look at it for 8 hours a day. So it must not be too distracting.
