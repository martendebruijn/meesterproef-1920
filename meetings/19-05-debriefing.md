# 19 May

The meeting started with Jo and Marcel reading our debriefs. We discussed them when they were finished reading.
It's important that Ringo will be build on three pillars:

- creative
- legal
- operational

We are going to work with both APIs and fake data.
We decided that Nick and I are going to make a couple of sketches. When the sketches are finished, we are going to send them to Jo and Marcel (before Monday). So we can discuss them in our meeting that we have planned on Monday.

Instead of the word 'enquiries', we are going to use 'actions'.
Preferable Ringo will have smart filters and a good recommondation section. Also they want the platform to have cultural filters.

A lot of information can be found on [all music](www.allmusic.com).

Jo and Marcel wrote in their brief that they like a clean form; like the way typeform does it. During this meeting Nick and I spoke our concern that we don't think this would work for the music search. As they also said that the platform would be primarly used by music supervisors - who spend like 8 hours a day at the platform - we believe that as a supervisor you don't want to go over a whole form everytime they want to search for music. We believe this because when someone searches for music it can be filtered by mood, tempo, instrument, etc.. But it isn't necessary to fill out every input element. In contrast this can be done with the process of filling out project information while creating a new project. With filling out the project details all (most) input fields are mandatory.

They definitely don't want a really form looking form.
